/** All interactions between database clients are mediated through a

 * Design REQUIREMENT: because clients can instantiate multiple instances of a
 * QueryEngine, implementations should NOT assume that state from a previous
 * method invocations is available for use by another methd invocation.
 *
 * Design REQUIREMENT: only the pre-defined tables (see the requirements doc)
 * may be used to persist information for this assignment.
 *
 * Design requirement: implementation MAY throw RuntimeException if parameters
 * are syntactically invalid (e.g., empty string), but MUST throws SQLException
 * if the database rejects an implementation-initiated command.
 *
 * Design REQUIREMENT:  all API engines execute on a per-transaction granularity.

   * attempt fails.
   *
   * All interactions with the database that are subsequently performed by this
   * instance must use this configuration information.

   * "valid": i.e., that a local Postgres database exists for which the
   * supplied credentials are valid.
